# ModOrganizer-PluginSync
A Mod Organizer 2 Plugin that syncs the order of plugins to match the order of mods.
It currently works by enabling all mods in load priority order.
I'm working on an update to improve performance by actually syncing and reordering rather than enabling all mods one at a time.
